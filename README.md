This is a fork of [Havit.Blazor.GoogleTagManager](https://github.com/havit/Havit.Blazor/tree/master/Havit.Blazor.GoogleTagManager) but without Havit.Core, since for Blazor WASM every byte counts.
This library is trim friendly.

## üéâ Release Notes
### [Changelog](https://github.com/ScarletKuro/Blazor.GoogleTagManager/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

## üöÄGetting Started
### Register Services
Blazor ServerSide or WASM
```CSharp
builder.Services.AddGoogleTagManager(options =>
{
      options.GtmId = "GTM-XXXXXXX";
});
```

### Add Imports
After the package is added, you need to add the following in your **_Imports.razor**
```CSharp
@using Blazor.GoogleTagManager;
```

### Add Components
Add the following component to your **MainLayout.razor**
```HTML
<GoogleTagManagerPageViewTracker />
```
**NB!** There is no need to add `_content/Blazor.GoogleTagManager/GoogleTagManager.js` in indedx.html / _Host.cshtml, the script is imported automatically. 

## üìúSample Usage
For general use case, please refer to [google tutorials](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6103696?hl=en) or any other learning materials.

### Manual push
Only if you need to trigger custom events from the code.

In the razor component
```CSharp
@inject IGoogleTagManager GoogleTagManager;

<button @onclick="OnButtonClick">Click</button>

@code {
  private async Task OnButtonClick(){
      await GoogleTagManager.PushAsync(new { @event = "button_click_sample_event" });
  }
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏èAdditional Settings
### Attributes
You can add attributes, this can be useful for cookie consent
```CSharp
builder.Services.AddGoogleTagManager(options =>
{
      options.GtmId = "GTM-XXXXXXX";
      options.Attributes = new Dictionary<string, string>
      {
            { "data-consent-category", "google" }
      };
});
```
then in your script you will see following
```HTML
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=GTM-XXXXXXX" data-consent-category="google"></script>
```
Other useful links for consent settings: [link1](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/10718549) [link2](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/templates/consent-apis)
### Debug to console
You can enable debugging to the browser console. This helps to see whatever the library is initialized properly.

Keep in mind that this will only output the events that is done by this library, it will not show the triggers that were configured in the [Google Tag Manager Dashboard](https://tagmanager.google.com/). For the rest, please, use this [debug](#debugging-your-google-tag-manager) section.
```CSharp
builder.Services.AddGoogleTagManager(options =>
{
      options.GtmId = "GTM-XXXXXXX";
      options.DebugToConsole = true;
});
```
Example output
```
[GTM]: Configured with GtmId = GTM-XXXXXXX
[GTM]:{"pageUrl":"https://localhost:5001/","event":"virtualPageView"}
[GTM]:{"isNavigationIntercepted":"True","pageUrl":"https://localhost:5001/counter","event":"virtualPageView","gtm.uniqueEventId":14}
[GTM]:{"event":"button_click_sample_event","gtm.uniqueEventId":16}
[GTM]:{"event":"button_click_sample_event","gtm.uniqueEventId":17}
```
**‚ö†Ô∏èNB!** Do not use this option in production.

## üì¢Troubleshooting
If nothing happens, even a simple `pageview` event, and you are sure you configured the library and Google Tag Manager correctly, then check if adblocker/firewall doesn't block the Google Tag Manager script. For example, AdGuard by default can remove tracking scripts.

Try to use [console](#debug-to-console) and other [tools](#debugging-your-google-tag-manager) to make sure that the script(`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=GTM-XXXXXXX`) is present on the page and that you have access to dataLayer object.

### Debugging your Google Tag Manager
There is [debug](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6107056?hl=en) / [tag assistant](https://tagassistant.google.com/) feature for Google Tag Manager that will always help you to debug your triggers and show that your GTM is hooked up properly.

## üìåLimitations / Not Supported Scenarios
There is no support for the [Content Security Policy](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/web/csp) out of the box, as that would require additional JavaScript modification.

There is also no support for [renaming](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/web/datalayer#tag-manager) the dataLayer object for the Google Tag Manager.
